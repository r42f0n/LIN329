Please submit your final paper in hard copy at the beginning of   lecture   on   December   3,   2024.
Length/formatting restrictions 
Your paper should fit the following requirements:
•            1.5-spaced
•         Margins of   at least 2.54 cm   (1   inch)
•            12-point font
•         Eight to twelve pages, including examples, tableaux, and references
•         The   paragraph   about   how   you   incorporated   feedback   from   your   abstract   can   be   on   an   additional page
Components of the final paper 
Your   final   paper   should   include   the   following   components.   They   don’t   need   to   be   in   this   order.   The requirements for each of   these are explained in more   detail   following   the   list.
•         A   title
•         Information   on   the   language
•         Definition   of   the   phonological   phenomenon
•         Examples   from   the   language
•         Description   of   the   pattern
•         Explanation   about   what   is   interesting   about   the   pattern
•         Optimality   Theoretic   analysis
•         Discussion
•         References
•         A   paragraph   about   how   you   incorporated   feedback   from   your   abstract
Title, information on the language, definition of the phenomenon, examples from the language, description of the pattern, explanation about what is interesting, and references: These   all   have   the   same   requirements   as   in   the   abstract.   They   can   be   taken   directly   from   your   abstract or changed as appropriate based on feedback you received. You can also expand upon any   of   them, since you have more space in the paper than you did in   the   abstract.
Optimality Theoreti代 写LIN329 – Final paperMatlab
代做程序编程语言c analysis: Your paper must include an Optimality Theory analysis of   the   data.   This   should be   a   full   analysis   of   all the facts that you have presented about the phenomenon in the language. The analysis should   include:
•         A   list   of   constraints, with   definitions   for   all   of   them
•         At least one   pairwise comparison to illustrate   how   you came   up   with one   part of   the   ranking
•         A   ranking   of   all   of   the   constraints   you’re   using
•         At   least   two   full   tableaux,   illustrating   the   application   of   your   analysis   to   two   of   your   examples
•         Each   of   the   two   full   tableaux   should   contain   all   of   your   constraints   and   at   least   four   candidates
•         There   should be   enough   candidates   in   your   full   tableaux   to   illustrate   the   relevance   of all   constraints
Discussion: Your paper must   include   a   discussion.   This   should be   around   2-3 paragraphs   at   a   minimum,   but can be longer if   you have more to say.   Some things you could discuss   include   (but   are not   limited to):   whether your   analysis   fully   accounts   for   all   of the   data,   any   remaining   questions,   additional   points   of   interest   about   the   analysis,   or   a   conjecture   about   the   applicability   of   your   analysis   more broadly in the language and/or for the same phenomenon in   other   languages.
Paragraph about how you incorporated feedback: 
Write a paragraph explaining how you took the feedback   from your   abstract   into   consideration   in   writing your final paper. This can be on a separate page   from the   rest   of   the paper.
